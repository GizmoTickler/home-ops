# Gemini Code Assistant Report

## Project Overview

This repository, `home-ops`, is a comprehensive GitOps setup for managing a homelab Kubernetes cluster. It leverages a variety of modern technologies to automate and streamline the entire infrastructure lifecycle, from provisioning to application deployment.

The core of the project is a Kubernetes cluster running on ESXi VMs, with storage provided by TrueNAS. The infrastructure is managed as code using Talos, an immutable and secure Linux distribution for Kubernetes. GitOps principles are implemented using Flux, which continuously synchronizes the cluster state with the configuration defined in this repository.

A custom command-line interface (CLI) tool, `homeops-cli`, is included to simplify and automate common administrative tasks. This CLI is written in Go and provides a rich set of commands for managing the cluster, including bootstrapping, node management, and volume operations.

The project also includes a sophisticated monitoring and observability stack, a robust networking architecture, and a variety of self-hosted applications.

## Building and Running

The `homeops-cli` is the primary tool for interacting with the cluster. It can be built and run from the `cmd/homeops-cli` directory.

### Build Commands

- **Build the `homeops-cli` binary:**
  ```bash
  make build
  ```

- **Build a release version of the `homeops-cli` binary:**
  ```bash
  make build-release
  ```

### Test Commands

- **Run all tests:**
  ```bash
  make test
  ```

- **Run unit tests only:**
  ```bash
  make test-unit
  ```

- **Run integration tests:**
  ```bash
  make test-integration
  ```

- **Run tests with coverage:**
  ```bash
  make test-coverage
  ```

### Linting and Formatting

- **Run the linter:**
  ```bash
  make lint
  ```

- **Format the code:**
  ```bash
  make fmt
  ```

## Development Conventions

The project follows a set of well-defined development conventions to ensure code quality and consistency.

### GitOps with Flux

The `kubernetes` directory contains the core of the GitOps configuration. Flux monitors this directory and automatically applies any changes to the cluster. The configuration is organized by namespace, with each application having its own dedicated directory.

The Flux configuration is managed using Kustomize. The main Kustomization file is located at `kubernetes/apps/flux-system/kustomization.yaml`. This file defines the resources that Flux will manage, including the Flux instance itself.

The `flux-local` tool is used in a GitHub Actions workflow to test and diff the Kubernetes manifests before they are applied to the cluster. This ensures that the manifests are valid and provides a preview of the changes.

### Custom CLI

The `homeops-cli` provides a consistent and automated way to manage the cluster. It is built using the Cobra library and includes a variety of commands for common administrative tasks.

### CI/CD

The project uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD. The `.github/workflows` directory contains the workflow definitions. The `flux-local.yaml` workflow is used to test and diff the Kubernetes manifests on pull requests.

### Dependency Management

The project uses Go modules for dependency management. The `go.mod` file in the `cmd/homeops-cli` directory lists the project's dependencies.

### Makefile

The `Makefile` in the `cmd/homeops-cli` directory provides a set of common commands for building, testing, and linting the `homeops-cli`. This is the central entry point for all development tasks.
